I ran each input file twice, sending the output to a file.
The output file names indicate the flags used (sl is stack
mode, list output, etc.).

The small input files took about 0.01 seconds or less to
complete.  The large input files were around 1.25 seconds.
Your times may vary due to hardware, so don't use these
as a strict guide.
